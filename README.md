# Stacks, Queues && LIFO and FIFO

- ## About the Repository

This repo contains the basics of stacks, queues, LIFO, FIFO and the bizzare bytecode language Monty. At the end of it, one should know what the difference between a stack and a queue is and when to use each. It will touch on the common implementations, and other such things. Want to know what that really means? Take a step into the project.
